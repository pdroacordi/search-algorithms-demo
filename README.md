# Greedy and A* Algorithm Demonstrations in Python

Welcome to my personal project demonstrating the implementation of Greedy algorithms and the A* search algorithm in Python. This repository is intended for learning and experimentation purposes.

# Overview

This repository contains implementations of:

* Greedy Algorithms: Exploring how greedy choices can lead to optimal solutions in certain problems.
* A* Search Algorithm: Practicing the A* algorithm for pathfinding in graphs.
The main goal is to enhance understanding of these algorithms through hands-on coding.

# Usage

In this scenario, I implemented both algorithms to be used in the same graph and same heuristic:
